### Lyrics

  > *`... holes of my sweater*

  > *And if I may just take your breath away*

  > *I don't mind if there's not much to say*

  > *Sometimes the silence guides a mind*

  > *To move to a place so far away*

  > *The goosebumps start to raise*

  > *The minute that my left hand meets your waist*

  > *And then I watch your face*

  > *Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste, yeah*

  > *These hearts adore, everyone the other beats hardest for*

  > *Inside this place is warm*

  > *Outside it starts to pour*

  > *Coming down*

  > *One love, two mouths*

  > *One love, one house*
 
  > *No shirt, no blouse*

  > *Just us, you find out*

  > *Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no*

  > *'Cause it's too cold*

  > *For you here*

  > *And now, so let me hold*

  > *Both your hands in the holes of my sweater*

  > *'Cause it's too cold*

  > *For you here*

  > *And now, so let me hold*

  > *Both your hands in the holes of my sweater*
