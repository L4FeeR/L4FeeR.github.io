#The Lost one

##What do you know about the lost-person?

Exactly am talking about the one who lost themselves in everything
who lost his interest in everything he loved before, 
who lost his hobby , who changed himself completely opposite to past him,
who became the one where he dont want to!
he who becomes the none!

It may sound crazy, but not everyone understand what am meaning here.
Lemme say this; if u donno what am referring,  heres the place for you to visit >> * <<

Okay, heres for you,

	Do you really think u can bear any thing in your life?
	
Everything has a starting point, 
If yes for the question i asked, then tell me at which point u feel that, lemme know about urself for some purpose

Lemme say something about them, 
	yup i saw some people in that state, being one among them, i can explain about them.

- They feel lonely deep inside even they got everything,
- They got many friends, they spent time with them, but if u watch closely they really dont want to hangout with them,
- They no more enjoying the thing that they spent too much time in past as enjoying thing
- They laugh much just inorder to hide thier feelings and easily pretend like they are enjoying.
- If u ask about their exact problem, they literally try to cry in that place, but force themself to not to
and try to leave the place or the topic.
- Always think about something that'll never happen,
- Nightmares kill them a lot than u think.But they never discuss these kinda things to anyone, they just keep it themself
- They dont give a fuck anymore that made them like that,


If u see such persons, just dont disturb them, as they already gone through something that we dont know anything about it
