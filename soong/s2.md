###    Lyrics


   > *So, baby, pull me closer*

   > *In the back seat of your Rover*

   > *That I know you can't afford*

   > *Bite that tattoo on your shoulder*

   > *Pull the sheets right off the corner*

   > *Of that mattress that you stole*

   > *From your roommate back in Boulder*

   > *We ain't ever getting older*

   > *We ain't ever getting older*

   > *We ain't ever getting older*

   > * * * * * *

###    Lyrics

   > *Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothin' left to say*

   > *When I try to talk, you're always playin' board games*

   > *I wish I had monopoly over your mind*

   > *I wish I didn't care all the time*

   > *We're just playin' hide and seek*

   > *It's gettin' hard to breathe under the sheets with you*

   > *I don't wanna play no games*

   > *I'm tired of always chasin', chasin' after you*

   > *I don't give a fuck about you anyways*

   > *Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?*

   > *You never share your toys or communicate*

   > *I guess I'm just a play date to you*

   > * * * * * *
