###    Lyrics

    > *Let me be your leccy meter*

    > *And I'll never run out*

    > *Let me be the portable heater*

    > *That you'll get cold without*

    > *I wanna be your setting lotion (wanna be)*

    > *Hold your hair in deep devotion (How deep?)*

    > *At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean*

    > *Now I wanna be yours*

    > *Secrets I have held in my heart*

    > *Are harder to hide than I thought*

    > *Maybe I just wanna be yours*

    > *I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours*

    > *I wanna be yours, wanna be yours*

    > * wanna be yours, wanna be yours*

    > * * * * * *

###    Lyrics

    > *I got my red dress on tonight*

    > *Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight*

    > *Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style*

    > *High heels off, I'm feelin' alive*

    > *Oh, my God, I feel it in the air*

    > *Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare*

    > *Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere*

    > *Nothin' scares me anymore*

    > *Kiss me hard before you go*

    > *Summertime sadness*

    > *I just wanted you to know*

    > *That baby, you the best*

    > *I got that summertime, summertime sadness*

    > *Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness*

    > *Got that summertime, summertime sadness*

    > *Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh*

    > * * * * * *
