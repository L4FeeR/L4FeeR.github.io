###    Lyrics

   > *Let me be your leccy meter*

   > *And I'll never run out*

   > *Let me be the portable heater*

   > *That you'll get cold without*

   > *I wanna be your setting lotion (wanna be)*

   > *Hold your hair in deep devotion (How deep?)*

   > *At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean*

   > *Now I wanna be yours*

   > *Secrets I have held in my heart*

   > *Are harder to hide than I thought*

   > *Maybe I just wanna be yours*

   > *I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours*

   > *I wanna be yours, wanna be yours*

   > * wanna be yours, wanna be yours*

   > * * * * * *

###    Lyrics

   > *I got my red dress on tonight*

   > *Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight*

   > *Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style*

   > *High heels off, I'm feelin' alive*

   > *Oh, my God, I feel it in the air*

   > *Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare*

   > *Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere*

   > *Nothin' scares me anymore*

   > *Kiss me hard before you go*

   > *Summertime sadness*

   > *I just wanted you to know*

   > *That baby, you the best*

   > *I got that summertime, summertime sadness*

   > *Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness*

   > *Got that summertime, summertime sadness*

   > *Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh*

   > * * * * * *

###    Lyrics

   > *Usually I put somethin' on TV*

   > *So we never think about you and me*

   > *But today I see our reflections*

   > *Clearly in Hollywood, layin' on the screen*

   > *You just need a better life than this*

   > *You need somethin' I can never give*

   > *Fake water all across the road*

   > *It's gone now, the night has come, but*

   > *Sometimes, all I think about is you*

   > *Late nights in the middle of June*

   > *Heat waves been fakin' me out*

   > *Can't make you happier now*

   > *You can't fight it, you can't breathe*

   > *You say something so lovin', but*

   > *Now I gotta let you go*

   > *You'll be better off in someone new*

   > *I don't wanna be alone*

   > *You know it hurts me too*

   > *You look so broken when you cry*

   > *One more and then I say goodby*

   > *Sometimes, all I think about is you*

   > *Late nights in the middle of June*

   > *Heat waves been fakin' me out*

   > *Can't make you happier now*

   > *Sometimes, all I think about is you*

   > *Late nights in the middle of June*

   > *Heat waves been fakin' me out*

   > *Can't make you happier now*

   > *I just wonder what you're dreamin' of*

   > *When you sleep and smile so comfortable*

   > *I just wish that I could give you that*

   > *That look that's perfectly un-sad*

   > *Sometimes, all I think about is you*

   > *Late nights in the middle of June*

   > *Heat waves been fakin' me out*

   > *Heat waves been fakin' me out*

   > *Sometimes, all I think about is you*

   > *Late nights in the middle of June*

   > *Heat waves been fakin' me out*

   > *Can't make you happier now*

   > * * * * * *
